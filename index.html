                Ever since i have discovered programming 3 years back, i have spent countless hours in front of my monitor putting pieces of code together and seeing them do something infront of my very eyes. 
                This new found passion led me into dwelling different types of development that include, web development, mobile app development and even game development.
                I love coding and love to bring them into a form of fun and useful applications. 
                My objective is to become a software developer so I can put my passion into something I want to do for life!!!</p>
